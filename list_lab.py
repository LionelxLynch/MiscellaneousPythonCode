# Notes on the lab for list (This will help with understanding list data structres)

# So, were going to make a cleaner version of assignment 4b using list.

# Here's the requirements for the program

# 1. Use at least 3 functions
# - One for the qudratic computation 
# - One for generating y-vaules
# - One for outputing all results for both lists

# 2. Have a main function

# 3. Have a main entrance 

# Lets first start by asking the user for inputs for a, b, and c
a =  input('What is the value of a: ')
b = input('What is the value of b: ')
c = input ('What is the value of c: ')

# Now we want to create a list that can store the X-values 0,1,2...,9,10,100,1000,...,10000000

x_values = []
